### 🟩 2. **Food Delivery App**

```markdown
# 🍕 Food Delivery App

This is a simple food delivery UI built with React and Tailwind CSS. It shows restaurant menus, and lets users add/remove items from cart. I built it to practice routing and state management in React.

## 🧰 What I Used
- React.js
- React Router
- useState & useEffect

## 💡 Key Features
- Dynamic restaurant listing
- Add to cart / remove from cart
- Multiple pages using routing
- Clean responsive UI using Tailwind

## ▶️ Run Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/varunmarulkar/food-delivery-app.git
cd food-delivery-app
npm install
npm start
